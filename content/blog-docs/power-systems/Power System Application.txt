Power System Optimization & Data Analytics: A Smarter Grid in Action
In today’s increasingly dynamic energy environment, utilities are expected to do more with less—optimize aging infrastructure, reduce outages, and integrate renewables, all while maintaining grid reliability. That’s where power system optimization and data analytics come into play.
Organizations like PMI, SEL, and knowledge platforms such as Medium have long emphasized the value of data-driven project execution and real-time system visibility. But theory meets reality when real utilities apply these tools—and succeed.
Real-World Example: Austin Energy (2024)
In 2024, Austin Energy, one of the nation’s largest publicly owned electric utilities, launched a grid analytics initiative focused on transformer health and voltage optimization. Using SEL RTACs and smart transformer monitors, they collected voltage imbalance data and correlated it with weather and loading patterns using a lightweight machine learning model.
This allowed them to:
•	Detect and resolve voltage imbalances before customer complaints occurred
•	Predict failing transformers up to 30 days in advance
•	Avoid over $200,000 in potential outage-related costs
The solution was powered by:
•	SEL Real-Time Automation Controllers
•	ArcGIS and Looker Studio for visualization
•	PMI’s best practices for project delivery
This success story shows the power of blending protection engineering, field data, and modern analytics—all toward building a more resilient, intelligent grid.
